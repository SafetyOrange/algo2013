##Non-Code:
0) Take a video of real world particles.  Here's an example: https://vimeo.com/28732551

##Code:
1. If you didn't finish the John Whitney assignment from last week, just finish that one.
2. Instead of writing an email (it's ok if you already did) add to this piratepad if there are topics you'd like to go over more in a class soon.  http://piratepad.net/kPg029KxBx
3. These core ideas translate across any language. Make a version of the line follow creature - in processing (processing.org)  The processing docs are quite good as well http://processing.org/reference/.
4. create a looping fireworks animation (non interactive). You will need to reset or restart particles every so often.  Take a look at the last code example from class today (NoiceParticles) to see how to delete from a vector safely!
